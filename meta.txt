3 files / folders


---MRI---

The mri contains the prostate MRI data of 204 patients (pt_0000 - pt_0203). Correspondingly, there are 204 subfolders in mri, named by the patient ID.

Each subfolder contains three images / parametric maps:

	- T2-weighted images (T2w) (The sequence weighting highlights differences in the T2 relaxation time of tissues);
		- T2 relaxation refers to the progressive dephasing of spinning dipoles following the 90Â° pulse as seen in a spin-echo sequence due to tissue-particular characteristics, primarily those that affect the rate of movement of protons, most of which are found in water molecules.

	- Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps (parent diffusion coefficient (ADC) is a measure of the magnitude of diffusion (of water molecules) within tissue);

	- Forward transfer constant (Ktrans) maps.

These data are transfer into one spatial coordinate (co-registered), so they correspond at the voxel (volume + pixel) level. In another word, instead of just having one T2w image which gives the anatomial inforamtion, the ADC and Ktrans maps can provide extra functional information. This is similar to the relationship between a black-and-white image (one channel) and a coloured image (three channels).

The data is in NIfTI (.nii) format. You will need to use nibabel to read the data into Python.


---INFO.CSV---

The info.csv contains the information for the learning task. Each sample, a suspicious lesion in this case, is called a finding. A finding may or may not be a clinically significant prostate cancer (CS-PCa). Hence the learning task is to predict whether a finding is CS-PCa. Note that each patient could have one or more finding(s). In this task, there are 204 patients and 326 findings.

index: sample index;
pt_id: patient ID;
Name: the name of the imaging sequence; Can be ignored, as all imaging data are co-registered; (all t2w)
fid: finding ID; Each patient may have one or more finding(s). Starts from 1 for each patient;
ijk: the location of the finding (starts from 0, i.e. the first column, second row in the third slice is shown as 0, 1, 2);
Dim: the dimension of the image;
label: whether the finding is CS-PCa.

---VIS---

To help you confirm that you've get the right place, visualisations have been created. This is inside the vis folder, group by the labels. These visualisations are generated by another package by R (16-bit images), and there are some rotation / flipping differences. This won't cause issues if you read the data consistently using the same tool. The goal of vis is for confirmation only. Don't use it for any training purposes.
