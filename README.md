_Final Report marking instruction_:

> The report will be written by the group and will be marked by the academic supervisor. Please submit one report per group, 
> and advise the academic supervisor of your project.

> The report should be a group effort and each student in the group should contribute equally. This report can be written in a > style suitable for the informed reader (supervisor), that is, in the style of a scientific publication. Area-specific terms > and jargon can be used.

> The word limit is 2000. References and figures (and brief figure captions) should be included, but do not count toward the 
> word limit, just like a professional report or an article in a scientific journal. You can use any subject-appropriate 
> referencing style; a good idea is to model it on your choice of a scientific journal in the subject. Your abstract counts 
> toward the word limit. Text details are: 12-point font, fully justified text and 1.5 line spacing. 

> If you include an appendix, it does not count towards the word limit, but the marker is not required to read it. In other 
> words, only include supplementary material not essential to the report as an appendix.

> The criteria for assessment of the report are:

> English expression, layout and general presentation
> Clear definition of the problem
> Interpretation of the information
> The validity of the conclusions reached or ideas formulated from the information obtained
> The degree to which independent thought has been involved
> The general understanding of the scientific principles underlying the topic

_Final presentation marking instruction_:

> Groups wishing to make use of electronic projection facilities must format their presentation for MS PowerPoint for a PC.  
> Alternative software, operating systems and laptop computers are not supported.  Final slides must be submitted here by 
> 11:59pm on the day before the showcase. (All groups' slides will then be collated to one master presentation.)

> The presentation will be five minutes (excluding questions) for each group. During the presentation your entire group will 
> be required to be on stage, but you can decide how each member participates. (E.g, everyone speaks for about a minute, or 
> choose one speaker and some others assist with props, five speakers and one "clicker", etc.) You'll have a chance to test 
> your presentation on stage and make minor adjustments (to your speech, but not your slides) at the rehearsal.

> At the conclusion of the evening (i.e. once all the presentations are finished) we will ask one representative from each 
> group to return to the stage to answer questions from the audience. It is up to you and your leader to decide how you can 
> most effectively get the message across in the presentation. In contrast to the report, the audience will be general and the > presentation should therefore also be general. The oral presentation will be assessed by the Dalyell coordinators (mentors) > attending the showcase evening.

> Criteria for assessment of the presentation:

> Quality of presentation: Were the visual aids clear and was the point of each slide obvious? Were the details of each slide > properly explained? Was the overall narrative and logic of presentation easy to follow?
> Was your attention engaged as the presentation unfolded?
> Did the group keep to time?

> Overall design and structure of the talk: Was the presentation structured in a way that was comprehensible? Did it include 
> intelligible and relevant background material? A clear definition of the problem? An ordered progression of important
> concepts and findings? Is there a concise summary and conclusion? Did you acquire an overall picture of the topic?
> Scientific context and understanding: Did the speaker/s put the work in context making coherent links to background work and > other disciplines where appropriate; critically analyse the information, successfully identify the most critical and 
> important components of research data, understand the relevance of their focus in the context of the discipline area; 
> understand the future implications and significance? Did the speakers make clear the distinction between background and 
> their own work/ analysis/ findings?

> Answers to questions: Did the students know the answers to relevant questions? Were the answers explained in a comprehensible way? Did the student demonstrate reserves of extra knowledge or was a lack of knowledge exposed?
