_Final Report marking instruction_:

>The report will be written by the group and will be marked by the academic supervisor. Please submit one report per group, >and advise the academic supervisor of your project.

>The report should be a group effort and each student in the group should contribute equally. This report can be written in a >style suitable for the informed reader (supervisor), that is, in the style of a scientific publication. Area-specific terms >and jargon can be used.

>The word limit is 2000. References and figures (and brief figure captions) should be included, but do not count toward the >word limit, just like a professional report or an article in a scientific journal. You can use any subject-appropriate >referencing style; a good idea is to model it on your choice of a scientific journal in the subject. Your abstract counts >toward the word limit. Text details are: 12-point font, fully justified text and 1.5 line spacing. 

>If you include an appendix, it does not count towards the word limit, but the marker is not required to read it. In other >words, only include supplementary material not essential to the report as an appendix.

>The criteria for assessment of the report are:

>English expression, layout and general presentation
>Clear definition of the problem
>Interpretation of the information
>The validity of the conclusions reached or ideas formulated from the information obtained
>The degree to which independent thought has been involved
>The general understanding of the scientific principles underlying the topic
