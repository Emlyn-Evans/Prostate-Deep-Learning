> Groups wishing to make use of electronic projection facilities must format their presentation for MS PowerPoint for a PC.  
> Alternative software, operating systems and laptop computers are not supported.  Final slides must be submitted here by 
> 11:59pm on the day before the showcase. (All groups' slides will then be collated to one master presentation.)

> The presentation will be five minutes (excluding questions) for each group. During the presentation your entire group will 
> be required to be on stage, but you can decide how each member participates. (E.g, everyone speaks for about a minute, or 
> choose one speaker and some others assist with props, five speakers and one "clicker", etc.) You'll have a chance to test 
> your presentation on stage and make minor adjustments (to your speech, but not your slides) at the rehearsal.

> At the conclusion of the evening (i.e. once all the presentations are finished) we will ask one representative from each 
> group to return to the stage to answer questions from the audience. It is up to you and your leader to decide how you can 
> most effectively get the message across in the presentation. In contrast to the report, the audience will be general and the > presentation should therefore also be general. The oral presentation will be assessed by the Dalyell coordinators (mentors) > attending the showcase evening.

> Criteria for assessment of the presentation:

> Quality of presentation: Were the visual aids clear and was the point of each slide obvious? Were the details of each slide > properly explained? Was the overall narrative and logic of presentation easy to follow?
> Was your attention engaged as the presentation unfolded?
> Did the group keep to time?

> Overall design and structure of the talk: Was the presentation structured in a way that was comprehensible? Did it include 
> intelligible and relevant background material? A clear definition of the problem? An ordered progression of important
> concepts and findings? Is there a concise summary and conclusion? Did you acquire an overall picture of the topic?
> Scientific context and understanding: Did the speaker/s put the work in context making coherent links to background work and > other disciplines where appropriate; critically analyse the information, successfully identify the most critical and 
> important components of research data, understand the relevance of their focus in the context of the discipline area; 
> understand the future implications and significance? Did the speakers make clear the distinction between background and 
> their own work/ analysis/ findings?

> Answers to questions: Did the students know the answers to relevant questions? Were the answers explained in a comprehensible way? Did the student demonstrate reserves of extra knowledge or was a lack of knowledge exposed?
